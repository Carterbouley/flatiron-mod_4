Our client was a tech influencer looking to start a successfull Tech focussed Youtube channel

We used number of views as a proxy variable to represent success of the channel.

We analysed youtube meta-data to look at what objective metrics could be useful to help formate their video production. 

As an extension we also used time series analysis to predict views based purely on channal popularity growth
